Python bindings for [DART][dart], the Dynamic Animation and Robotics Toolkit.


## Dependencies

* Boost.Python
* [Chimera][chimera] (only for generating new bindings)
* [Boost.Numpy][boost_numpy] (build from source)
* [Boost.Numpy/Eigen][boost_numpy_eigen] (build from source)
* [DART][dart] (tested on `f4e5604390418aa123458a786bcfbd14a4f289fc`, current
  as of 2/11/2016)

If [`wstool`][wstool] is available, you can use this `.rosinstall` file to
checkout Chimera, Boost.Python, Boost.NumPy/Eigen, and DART from source:
```yaml
- git:
    local-name: boost_numpy
    uri: https://github.com/personalrobotics/Boost.NumPy.git
- git:
    local-name: boost_numpy_eigen
    uri: https://github.com/personalrobotics/Boost.NumPy_Eigen.git
- git:
    local-name: chimera
    uri: https://github.com/personalrobotics/chimera.git
    version: feature/catkin
- git:
    local-name: dart
    uri: https://github.com/dartsim/dart.git
    version: f4e5604390418aa123458a786bcfbd14a4f289fc
- git:
    local-name: dartpy
    uri: https://github.com/personalrobotics/dartpy.git
    version: chimera
```

If these packages are in a [Catkin workspace][catkin_workspace], you can follow
[these instructions][prl_dev] to use [`catkin-tools`][catkin_tools] to build
`dartpy` and its dependencies.

## Building

> :warning: **Warning:** The Boost.Python bindings generated by may not build
> in GCC. We suggest that you use [Clang][clang] 3.7 or above to avoid
> potential issues. If you are on [Ubuntu 14.04][ubuntu1404], builds of Clang
> are available in the [LLVM Apt repository][llvm_apt].

`dartpy` uses [CMake][cmake]. You should follow the standard CMake build
process:
```console
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
```

### Binding Generation

> :warning: **Warning:** Running Chimera is only necessary if you are using a
> version of DART that differs from the one listed above.

> :no_entry_sign: **Warning:** The C++ code generated by [`chimera`][chimera]
> do not currently build without manual intervention. We *strongly* suggest
> that you skip this step and use the snapshot of bindings included in this Git
> repository.

`dartpy` uses [`chimera`][chimera] to generate Boost.Python bindings from
DART's C++ header files. You can re-generate the bindings by building the
`bind` target:
```console
$ make bind
```
The generated files are stored in the [`src_generated`
directory](src_generated/). You should clear your `CMakeCache.txt` and re-run
`cmake` before proceeding.


### Building Packaged Bindings

Once the Boost.Python bindings are generated, either by: (1) running `chimera`
or (2) using the incldued files, you can build the Python extension module.
`dartpy` contains a cached copy of the Boost.Python bindings in the
[`src_generated` directory](src_generated/). You can build those:
```console
$ make
$ make install
```

## Usage

Once `dartpy` is installed, you should be able to open a Python terminal and
`import dartpy`. Since `dartpy` is mostly auto-generated using Chimera, the
DART Python API mostly matches the DART C++ API.

There are a few exceptions:


### Template Functions

Template functions take the template parameters as regular arguments, e.g. the
C++ code:
```c++
auto joint = bodynode.moveTo<dart::dynamics::FreeJoint>(newParent);
```
becomes the Python code
```python
joint = bodynode.moveTo(dartpy.dynamics.FreeJoint, newParent)
```

Due to limitations of C++, support for template arguments is *limited to C++
classes provided with DART*. For example, the following code would result in a
runtime error:
```python
joint = bodynode.moveTo(MyCustomJoint, newParent)
```
